                    <h2>Six Ways To Make Your Cat Feel At Home</h2>
                    <p>This sometimes runs counter to how we live our lives, particularly when it comes to our home environments. How can you get on the same page?

                            Here are a few ways you can make your cat feel more comfortable in your home.In nature, cats often take to the trees. This keeps them hidden from predators, and gives them just the right vantage for surveying their territory and opportunistic hunting.

                            How can you introduce these elements to your home?
                            
                            You may already have some nice architectural features or furniture to work with. Fireplace mantels, tall bookcases, wall shelves, even the back of a sofa or chair can serve this purpose.
                            
                            Your cat gets to show off both natural agility and grace to get up and down. Plus it brings him or her a sense of comfort by getting up off the floor.
                            
                            If furniture is off limits, you can increase the vertical space in your home with cat trees or cat clouds. These are cleverly designed climbing structures and wall shelves made especially for felines. </p>
