                            <p>Hello everyone! I welcome you on my website. I am going to introduce you with my creative world. Aiming to give everyone the moments of happiness, I put in my paintings a piece of my soul and my heart. Each painting is not just the image of the world through the eyes of an artist, it is a new interpretation of the world where I clearly aim to transform the everyday into something extraordinary, that would delay you from problems and moments of sadness.</p>
    <p>My name is Kseniia Korniienko. I am a Ukrainian artist. I have been studying in Children’s Art School in Kyiv (2000-2008), International Institute of Fashion and Design on the Graphic Design major (2009-2010), and Andre Tan Fashion Academy (sewing) in 2015-2016. Of course, I have general education (Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv on the major “International Law” (2010-2016)), but all my life is connected with ART.</p>
