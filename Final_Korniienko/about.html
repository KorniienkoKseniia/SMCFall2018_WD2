      <h3>Environmental Promise</h3>
      
      <p>Reduce, Reuse and Recycle is what we do.
        We take pride in our role as an environmentally responsible organization. For example, each year we receive more than 2.6 million donations of unwanted items. Reselling these goods not only helps fund training and job placement for over 32,000 people, it also saves over 100 million pounds of usable goods and waste from landfills.</p>
